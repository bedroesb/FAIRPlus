  "description": "DM-75: A sample is a portion of plant tissue harvested, non-harvested or extracted from an observation unit for the purpose of sub-plant observations and/or molecular studies. A sample must be used when there is a physical sample that needs to be stored and traced. Otherwise, observations made at the sub-plant level should be recorded as plant level observations using the observed variables to characterize the object of the observation (e.g. Berry sugar content, Fruit weight, Grain Protein content, Leaf 1 width, Leaf 2 width, Leaf 2 length).",
