# Transcriptomics schema 

This schema combines MINSEQE and EBI DSP submission standard.

The EBI DSP submission organize samples, studys, assays in different files. To support DSP submission, we didn't provide a general root schema. 

The property of some attributes are objects instead of strings, so that it could be uploaded to DSP.
